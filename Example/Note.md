# Introduction
This is an example of what the code can accomplish. In this example, using the process that has been in place - 8 excel files (or at the very least 8 sheets) would need to be created and modified for analysis of the data received, and 9 word document letters would be sent out as a result.

This code takes in the data received and can output the same 8 excel files and 9 word docuemnts. However, it is also dynamic and can generate 2 summary Excel sheets are created along with 2 word documents making the process much more efficient.
