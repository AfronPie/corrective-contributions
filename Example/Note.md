# Introduction
This is an example of what the code can accomplish. In this example:

<ins> Using the process that has been in place <ins> 
* 8 excel files (or at the very least 8 sheets) would need to be created and modified for analysis of the data received
* 9 word document letters would be sent out as a result.

<ins> Using the code shown in the folders above <ins>
* Data is orgznized and converted into a 1 CSV file
* Python code can generate 2 summary Excel sheets along with 2 word documents making the process much more efficient
* Python code is also dynamic in that it can generate the same 8 excel files, and 9 word docuemnts shown above (with the analysis done)
