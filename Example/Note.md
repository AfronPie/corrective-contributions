# Explanation
This is an example of what the code can accomplish at it's best. In this example:

<ins> Using the process that has been in place using solely excel <ins> 
* 8 excel files would need to be created and modified for analysis of the data received
* 9 word document letters would be sent out as a result

<ins> Using the python code from this repository <ins>
* Data is organized and converted into a 1 CSV file (I attached the excel file as well in case the csv doesn't open)
* Python code can generate 2 summary Excel sheets along with 2 word documents making the process much more efficient
* Python code is also dynamic in that it can generate the same 8 excel files, and 9 word docuemnts described above (with the analysis/conclusions already done) if necessary

Also, as a general note:
The python code from this repository is best utilized when dealing with a complicated scenairo of corrective contributions (i.e. involving hundreds/thousands of rows of data). 
However, in a simple case (with just a couple of rows of data), it will likely be more efficient to use the process that has been in place using solely excel.
