# Note
This is the old/original version of the code. This code did not involve any SQL database (with the new version does), and actually had 2 seperate template files to run based on if we were dealing with solely EE (Employee) money, or both EE + ER (Employee + Employer) money.
The advantage to using it is that I have used it for longer, and have tested it and got rid of all the bugs (which I discovered).
